Republican support for President Donald Trump had been waning leading up to Wednesday's appointment of a [special counsel](https://www.ft.com/content/24d32d84-3b50-11e7-821a-6027b8a20f23) to oversee the FBI’s investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Several Republican senators had expressed concerns after Mr Trump’s [abrupt termination](https://www.ft.com/content/c857ad9a-3501-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) of FBI director James Comey. However the chorus quickly [grew louder](https://www.ft.com/content/24d32d84-3b50-11e7-821a-6027b8a20f23) this week after news broke that Mr Comey had written a memo saying that Mr Trump had urged him to [shut down](https://www.ft.com/content/36b254d4-3a84-11e7-821a-6027b8a20f23) the investigation into the president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.

While calls for an independent special prosecutor fell along party lines, Republicans were more split over expressing support for Mr Comey's dismissal. No Republicans called for a [special prosecutor](https://www.ft.com/content/88597dec-35cc-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) – though three said it might be on the table – and most GOP senators did not call for any further actions to be taken after this week's revelations.

Below is the FT’s guide to how Republicans and Democrats lined up on the issue before and after news of the Comey memo broke, starting with members of the Senate intelligence committee, who are conducting their own probe, and the Senate judiciary committee, as [the decision](https://www.ft.com/content/88597dec-35cc-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) to appoint a special prosecutor was made by the [US judicial branch](https://www.ft.com/content/8d5ba2d0-359e-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e).
