Attention quickly focused on reactions from the US legislature – and for good reason – after President Donald Trump suddenly fired FBI director James Comey in the midst of the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The US Senate will both confirm Mr Comey's replacement and conduct its own investigation into Russian interference through its intelligence committee.

Predictably, no Senate Democrats voiced support for Mr Trump’s decision. But Republicans are more split. Some Senate Republicans condemned Mr Comey’s dismissal, while others voiced at least some support. Still other Republicans released more vague or neutral statements that neither criticised nor praised the decision.

Nearly all Senate Democrats have called for a special independent prosecutor to investigate the Trump campaign’s Russia ties, while GOP senator John McCain stands alone among his fellow Republicans by calling for a special congressional committee.

Below the FT has compiled and – to the best of our abilities – categorized the responses of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is pursuing its own investigation into Russian interference in the election.

Eyes have also been on members of the Senate judiciary committee, which deals with matters to do with the US judicial branch. The decision whether to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Russian interference falls to deputy attorney-general Rod Rosenstein, whose memo Mr Trump used as reasoning for dismissing Mr Comey. Normally attorney-general Jeff Sessions, the head of the Department of Justice, would make the decision, but Mr Sessions recused himself from any such inquiries after he misled Congress about his contact with the Russian ambassador. 

Claims intensified that Mr Trump fired Mr Comey in an attempt to thwart the FBI Russian probe after reports emerged that Mr Comey had asked the Department of Justice for more resources for the investigation.
