Donald Trump’s [abrupt termination](https://www.ft.com/content/ea0d7efe-359e-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) of FBI director James Comey in the middle of an FBI probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election sent shockwaves through [Capitol Hill](https://www.ft.com/content/faec2454-364e-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e). How Senators respond to this action matters, as Mr Trump cannot appoint a replacement for Mr Comey without the Senate’s approval. At the same time, the Senate intelligence committee is conducting its own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Some Senate Republicans expressed concern about Mr Comey’s dismissal, or released more neutral statements that neither criticised nor praised the decision, while others voiced at least some support. Senator John McCain stands alone among Republicans by calling for a special congressional committee. 

The reaction among Democrats was more along party lines: no Senate Democrats have voiced support for Mr Trump’s decision. Nearly all Senate Democrats have called for a [special independent prosecutor](https://www.ft.com/content/88597dec-35cc-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) to investigate the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russian officials.

The FT has broken down how Republicans and Democrats have lined up on the issue, starting with members of the Senate intelligence committee, who are conducting their own probe, and the Senate judiciary committee, as [the decision](https://www.ft.com/content/88597dec-35cc-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) to appoint a special prosecutor falls to the [US judicial branch](https://www.ft.com/content/8d5ba2d0-359e-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e).
